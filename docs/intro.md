# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI**, a revolutionary field where artificial intelligence meets robotic embodiment.

Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in digital realms, Physical AI embodies intelligence in physical form, enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act in the real world. This book bridges the gap between abstract algorithms and tangible robotic systems.

## 📖 What This Book Covers
