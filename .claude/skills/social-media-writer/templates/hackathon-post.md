## Key Techniques from Gold Standard

**Rhythm & Pacing:**
- Ultra-short lines (2-3 words) for emphasis: "We hit them. Requests failed."
- Single-line dramatic effect: "I paused."
- Combined thoughts where natural: "Because real teams don't work like solo todo lists."
- Build tension → Problem → Solution → Insight

## Examples (Updated v2.0)

### Example 0: Spec-Driven Development (NEW - Using ✅ ❌ for clarity - 920 chars)

```
Hackathon complete. Built an AI textbook for humanoid robotics.

19 chapters on Physical AI.
With an interactive RAG chatbot.
Text selection Q&A.
Personalized learning paths.
Urdu translation support.

Tech stack:
 • Docusaurus + React
 • FastAPI backend
 • Qdrant vector DB
 • OpenAI embeddings
 • Better Auth v2

This build was different.

I didn't do vibe coding.
 ❌ No "let's see where this goes."

I used Spec-Driven Development.
 ✅ Every feature started with a spec.
 ✅ Every integration started with a plan.
 ✅ Every task was testable from day one.

This changed everything.
I stopped being just a developer.
I became an architect.

Before: I would jump into code.
Figure things out as I go.
Refactor when it broke.
Hope for the best.

Now: I design before I build.
Know what success looks like.
Execute against a plan.
Ship with confidence.

The workflow:
1. Write the spec (sp.specify)
2. Design the architecture (sp.plan)
3. Break into tasks (sp.tasks)
4. Implement against the plan
5. Ship when tests pass

AI doesn't replace thinking.
AI accelerates execution.
When you know what to build.

This hackathon felt smooth.
Not because it was easy.
Because I had a map.

Main takeaway:
Spec-driven AI development beats vibe coding every time.

The result works.
Demo is live.

How do you approach new projects?
Spec first or code first?

- Length: 920 chars ✓

### Example 1: Won Placement (Gold Standard Style - 820 chars)

```
Our team took 2nd place at the hackathon.

48 hours to build from scratch.

We built an AI task manager.
Using Python + FastAPI + React + OpenAI.

Main challenge?
API rate limits.

We hit them after 6 hours.
Requests started failing.
Users saw errors.

I panicked for a minute.

Then we implemented:
 • Request queuing
 • Local caching
 • Retry with backoff

Judges liked the fix.
And the clean UI.

Lesson:
Check rate limits before you start.
Not after you hit them.

Cost us 3 hours of debugging.

Ever hit an API limit?
How did you solve it?

- Ultra-short pacing: "Requests started failing. Users saw errors." ✓
- Hook: 8 words ✓
- Length: 820 chars ✓

### Example 2: Built Something Cool (Gold Standard Style - 850 chars)

```
Just finished a 24-hour hackathon.

Built a real-time code editor.

Tech stack:
 • WebSocket server
 • Monaco Editor
 • Operational Transformation

Biggest challenge?
Concurrent edits.

When two people type at once?
Whose change wins?

We tried everything.
Last-write-wins.
Timestamps.
Vector clocks.

Nothing worked well.

Then we found OT.
Same tech as Google Docs.
Each edit composes with others in any order.

Lesson:
Start with proven patterns.
Don't build your own conflict resolution.

Lost 4 hours on that.

### Example 3: Learning Experience (Gold Standard Style - 750 chars)

```
First hackathon. Didn't finish.

But I learned a lot.

The idea:
Plant disease detector.
Upload photo, get diagnosis.

The reality:
Model had 40% accuracy.
Plant diseases look similar in photos.
We didn't have good data.

I was disappointed.
We worked hard.
But the result was bad.

Then I realized:
We built a working app.
Used React Native.
Learned TensorFlow Lite.
Deployed to real phones.

That's more than most teams do.

Lesson:
Pick a smaller problem.
A working MVP beats an ambitious failure.

Still had fun.
Team was great.

### Example 4: Team Experience (Gold Standard Style - 780 chars)

```
Hackathons are about people.
Not just code.

We were 4 strangers.
By hour 6, we knew our roles:
 • Frontend: Sarah
 • Backend: Mike
 • Keeping us calm: Jamal
 • Testing: Me

We built a habit tracker.
Nothing fancy.
But it worked.

Challenge:
Merge conflicts at hour 20.

Everyone worked on different branches.
Chaos.

Solution?
One person handled merges.
Others kept building.

We won "Best Team Collaboration."

Lesson:
A good team beats a good idea.

### Example 5: Honest Failure (Gold Standard Style - 720 chars)

```
We didn't finish our hackathon project.

Here's what went wrong.

The idea:
Voice-controlled smart home dashboard.

The reality:
Speech recognition is hard.

Problems:
 • Background noise broke our model
 • API latency made it slow
 • Battery drain was huge

We adjusted.
Cut features.
Simplified the scope.

Still didn't finish.

Lesson:
Test core assumptions early.
We tested at hour 18.
Should have tested at hour 2.

Still learned a lot about audio.

## Checklist (v2.0)

Every hackathon post must include:

- [ ] **One-liner hook** (result or what built, under 12 words)
- [ ] **Max 3 lines per paragraph** (scannable on mobile)
- [ ] **White space after each line** (easy to read)
- [ ] Tech stack (brief, bullet points)
- [ ] Main challenge faced
- [ ] How you solved it (or what went wrong)
- [ ] What you'd do differently
- [ ] **CTA at end** (question or prompt)
- [ ] 3-5 relevant hashtags
- [ ] **700-1000 characters** (optimal length)
- [ ] Simple English (non-native friendly)
- [ ] **NO em-dash** (`—`) anywhere
- [ ] No banned AI words (delve, tapestry, underscore, pivotal, showcase)
- [ ] Bullets use `•` or `👉` or `→` or numbered list
- [ ] Emojis used for clarity only (✅ ❌ 🚫)

## Tone Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|----|
| Share failures too | Only post wins |
| Be honest | Pretend it was smooth |
| Give credit to team | Say "I built this alone" |
| Focus on learning | Focus only on winning |
| Keep it real | Use hype words |

## Common Mistakes (v2.0)

1. **Too much hype**: "We built the most revolutionary app!"
   - Fix: "We built a task manager using Python."

2. **No tech details**: "Used cutting-edge technology"
   - Fix: "Used FastAPI, React, and OpenAI API."

3. **Wall of text**: Long paragraphs describing everything
   - Fix: Max 3 lines per paragraph, add white space

4. **No CTA**: Post just ends with the result
   - Fix: Always end with "What's your hackathon story?"

5. **Fake modesty**: "I don't mean to brag but we won..."
   - Fix: "Our team took 2nd place."

## Platform Variations

### LinkedIn (700-1000 chars optimal)
- One-liner hook first
- Max 3 lines per paragraph
- Tech stack as bullets
- CTA required at end

### Twitter (200-270 chars, use thread)
```
1/ Just finished a 24-hour hackathon.
Built a real-time code editor.

Tech stack: Node.js + Socket.io, Monaco Editor, OT.

#hackathon #websocket

2/ Biggest challenge: Concurrent edits.

When two people type at once?
Whose change wins?

We used Operational Transformation (same as Google Docs).

3/ Lesson: Start with proven patterns.

Lost 4 hours trying to build our own conflict resolution.
