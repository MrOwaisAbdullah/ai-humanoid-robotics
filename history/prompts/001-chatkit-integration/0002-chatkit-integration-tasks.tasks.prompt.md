## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for ChatKit integration with:
- 41 specific implementation tasks across 7 phases
- Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation
- Clear dependency graph and parallel execution opportunities
- MVP scope definition for first release
- Detailed file paths and implementation strategy

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created actionable task list with clear execution order and parallel opportunities
- 🧪 Tests: Defined independent test criteria for each user story phase
- 📁 Files: Generated tasks.md with complete task breakdown
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Organized tasks by user story enables independent testing and incremental delivery

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow checklist format with proper IDs and file paths
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding performance optimization tasks after initial implementation
